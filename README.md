# Credit Card Default Prediction
### Overview
This is an end-to-end ML project, prediction of the next month credit card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral data of customers, which aims at developing a classification model for the problem of predicting credit card frauds using a given labeled dataset.

The classifier used for this project is Decision Tree Algorithm.

# Motivation
There are times when even a seemingly manageable debt, such as credit cards, goes out of control. Loss of job, medical crisis or business failure are some of the reasons that can impact your finances. In fact, credit card debts are usually the first to get out of hand in such situations due to hefty finance charges (compounded on daily balances) and other penalties.

A lot of us would be able to relate to this scenario. We may have missed credit card payments once or twice because of forgotten due dates or cash flow issues. But what happens when this continues for months? How to predict if a customer will be defaulter in next months?

With the growing number of credit card users, banks have been facing an escalating credit card default rate. This increase in defaults causes losses to the financial institutions along with the card holders. As such data analytics can provide solutions to tackle the current phenomenon and management of credit defaults. This project discusses the implementation of an model which predicts if a given credit card holder has a probability of defaulting in the following month, using their demographic data and behavioral data from the past 6 months.
